# CatTale
Welcome to the life sim video game CatTale. 
Attract new visitors to your sleepy town while building your restaurant empire - with the help of a few animal friends, of course.

Recruit beavers to construct new buildings.
Toss some cheese to the rats and they'll run your kitchen for you.
Try your hand at trading with the local raccoons, who have a wide variety of "gently used" goods...
Just don't ask where they came from...
